Changes from the original mod:

-Added a new entry in the config file called "WORLDGEN_CAMPFIRES_LIFETIME." This allows you to set the burn time for naturally generated campfires.
-Implemented the ability to add items held in the main hand as fuel to the campfire when right-clicking on it. This functionality is adapted from the handling of dropping items onto the campfire tile entity in the original mod.
